			<dd>After Black Goose Bistro had to close its doors after its owner admitted that she could not meet COVID19 restrictions, students, Robert Barker and Terrel King, decided to lend a helping hand. The restaurant, which has been around 1972, has changed little since it’s inception. The wildly popular bistro has managed to avoid technological improvements, because of the foot traffic it receives from being located so close to campus. Unfortunately when COVID19 hit it’s customer base began to dwindle. Owner, Kate Presley, said “I had hoped things would turn around, but when they announced [the six foot policy], I knew I’d have to close my doors.”<br><br>The hole-in-wall establishment is often cramped at the best of times. Student Robert Barker said “When I head it was shutting down. I knew I had to do something.” Barker got in touch with Presley and pitched an idea for online orders. Presley said “I heard about it before, but being tech illiterate it was never something I seriously considered.” She agreed to his plan, and with the help of IT major Terrel King they were able to make it a reality.</dd>

			<dd>This year’s Creative Solutions Fair ended with Rahaaj Prynik stealing the show. His report on quantum computing and day trading showed how every day investors could stand to boost their gains. “I think after GameStop things changed. Everybody wants to be on the ground floor for the next big thing, but nobody knows what it is. I think quantum computing could help us find it.” He his proposal was a quantum computing system that would analyze market data and online activity in real time. The system would scour popular trading image boards, forums, and social media for hot stocks. It would then cross examine this information with market information in order to find stocks that have a strong potential for growth. “The goal here really isn’t to find good long-term investments, it’s really about locating market manipulation and capitalizing on it.” Judge at the fair, Ruby Clemmens, was  especially blown away by the proposal. “[Rahaaj Prynik] did a spectacular job on his proposal. I just remember standing there thinking, I can finally quit my job.”</dd>

			<dd>On Tuesday part time researcher and Professor of Applied Hardware and Software Concepts, Matthew Dailey, released a paper about the severe technical issues present in the popular data warehouse Bedrock. “I had been working on it for awhile and I thought it was good, but at best I expected it to maybe a turn a few heads within the department.” It did turn heads though as it gained nation wide attention. Thirty-five year old bar owner, Peter Covick, stated “When I first saw it, I didn’t think much of it. It wasn’t until I went to work the next day that it really hit me.” Much like Covick many business owners rely, sometimes unknowingly, on Bedrock and many are finding that the problems they face within their businesses can be traced back to technical issues with their data warehouse. “We had had problems with orders not showing up in our ticket system for awhile. It was such a reoccurring problem we had to switch back to pen and paper.” stated Starbucks general manager, Trisha Rain. With light having been shed on the issues, the Bedrock’s owner Datalink released a statement on their twitter account stating “We are taking immediate steps to rectify the issues currently present wtihin Bedrock.”</dd>
